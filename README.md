RULE-BASED SIMPLE CHATBOT

This code defines a simple text-based chatbot using Python. Let's break it down step by step:

The simple_chatbot function takes a single argument user_input, which is the text input provided by the user.

Inside the function, the code checks for different patterns in the user_input to determine how the chatbot should respond.

If the user input contains the word "hello" (case insensitive), the chatbot responds with a greeting.

Example: If the user types "Hello there!", the chatbot would respond with "Hello! How can I assist you today?"
If the user input contains the phrase "how are you" (case insensitive), the chatbot responds with a message indicating that it's here to help.

Example: If the user types "How are you doing?", the chatbot would respond with "I'm just a chatbot, but I'm here to help you!"
Similarly, the code checks for other phrases like "what is your name" and "bye" to provide appropriate responses.

If none of the predefined patterns match the user input, the chatbot responds with a default "I'm sorry, I don't understand that."

The main loop of the program starts with a greeting from the chatbot and then enters a loop where it repeatedly waits for user input.

The loop continues indefinitely (while True:) until the user types "bye". When the user types "bye", the loop breaks, and the chatbot bids farewell and exits.

Inside the loop, the user's input is captured using the input function, and then it's passed to the simple_chatbot function to generate a response.

Finally, the chatbot's response is printed along with the user's input.

End of the summary this code demonstrates a basic interaction loop where the chatbot responds to specific user input patterns and provides predefined responses, and it can continue this interaction until the user decides to exit by typing "bye."
